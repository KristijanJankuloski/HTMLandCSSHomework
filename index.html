            <h3>Artemis I Map</h3>
            <p>
              Artemis I will be the first integrated flight test of NASA’s deep
              space exploration system: the Orion spacecraft, Space Launch
              System (SLS) rocket and the ground systems at Kennedy Space Center
              in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The first in a series of increasingly
              complex missions, Artemis I will be an uncrewed flight that will
              provide a foundation for human deep space exploration, and
              demonstrate our commitment and capability to extend human
              existence to the Moon and beyond. During this flight, the uncrewed
              Orion spacecraft will launch on the most powerful rocket in the
              world and travel thousands of miles beyond the Moon, farther than
              any spacecraft built for humans has ever flown, over the course of
              about a three-week mission.

            <h3>NASA Sets New Coverage for Artemis I Moon Mission Launch</h3>
            <p>
              NASA confirmed it remains on track for the launch of the Artemis I
              Moon mission during a two-hour launch window that opens at 1:04
              a.m. EST on Wednesday, Nov. 16. The launch countdown will begin
              at 1:24 a.m. on Monday, Nov. 14. Artemis I is the first integrated
              flight test of NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, an
              uncrewed Orion spacecraft, and the ground systems at the agency’s
              Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mission will pave the way for
              a crewed test flight and future human lunar exploration as part of
              Artemis. Following Hurricane Nicole, teams have conducted thorough
              assessments of the rocket, spacecraft, and associated ground
              systems and confirmed there were no significant impacts from the
              severe weather. The SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft arrived at
              Kennedy’s Launch Pad 39B on Nov. 4 and rode out the storm there.

            <h3>First Images from the James Webb Space Telescope</h3>
            <p>
              The dawn of a new era in astronomy has begun as the world gets its
              first look at the full capabilities of NASA’s James Webb Space
              Telescope, a partnership with ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA
              (Canadian Space Agency). The telescope’s first full-color images
              and spectroscopic data were released during a televised broadcast
              at 10:30 a.m. EDT (14:30 UTC) on Tuesday, July 12, 2022, from
              NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. These
              listed targets below represent the first wave of full-color
              scientific images and spectra the observatory has gathered, and
              the official beginning of Webb’s general science operations. They
              were selected by an international committee of representatives
              from NASA, ESA, CSA, and the Space Telescope Science Institute.

            <h3>Webb Reveals New Details in Pillars of Creation</h3>
            <p>
              Our James Webb Space Telescope has captured a new image of the
              famous Pillars of Creation—first imaged by the Hubble Space
              Telescope in 1995—that reveals new details about the region. The
              three-dimensional pillars look like majestic rock formations but
              are far more permeable. These columns are made up of cool
              interstellar gas and dust that sometimes appear semi-transparent
              in near-infrared light.
            </p>
            <p>
              Webb’s new view of the Pillars of Creation will help researchers
              revamp their models of star formation by identifying far more
              precise counts of newly formed stars, along with the quantities of
              gas and dust in the region. Over time, they will begin to build a
              clearer understanding of how stars form and burst out of these
              dusty clouds over millions of years.

            <h3>Hubble Inspects a Pair of Space Oddities</h3>
            <p>
              This image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows two of
              the galaxies in the galactic triplet Arp 248 – also known as
              Wild's Triplet – which lies around 200 million light-years from
              Earth in the constellation Virgo. The two large spiral galaxies
              visible in this image – which flank a smaller, unrelated
              background spiral galaxy – appear connected by a luminous bridge.
              This elongated stream of stars and interstellar dust is known as a
              tidal tail, and it formed by the mutual gravitational attraction
              of the two foreground galaxies.

            <p>
              Webb took one observation of the impact location before the
              collision took place, then several observations over the next few
              hours. Images from Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) show a
              tight, compact core, with plumes of material appearing as wisps
              streaming away from the center of where the impact took place.
